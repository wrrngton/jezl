You can check out the AWS infrastructurnd regions here: [https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)

It's a global infrastructure, meaning we can deploy apps to be global

## Regions

Regions have names, e.g us-east-1

A region is a cluster of data centres

Most services are region scoped.

Some factors in choosing regions could be:

- Compliance
- Latency
- Service availability (some regions don't have certain services)

Each region has 'zones', which are separate data centres from each other and are isolated from disasters.

Not all services are available in all regions, see here: [https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&loc=4](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&loc=4)
