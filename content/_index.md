This is my personal <a href="/blog">blog</a>, where I can jot down my thoughts on life, software and things i'm working on.

I also use it as a personal references for <a href="/snippets">code snippets</a> I routinely re-use and <a href="/notes">notes</a> on the things I am currently studying.

When i'm not doing this, i'm probably playing <a href="chess">chess</a>.
