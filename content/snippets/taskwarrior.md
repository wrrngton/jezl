## Manage spaces

The best way to manage spaces is by using context

```console
task context define work +work
```
Adds a new context called `work` and new items are registered to the context when the tag `work` is added to the task.

You can add a filter that anytime a task is added in the current context, it will have the context automatically attached to it.

To switch context:

```console
task context work
```

To clear context:

```console
task context none
```
